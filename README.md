Rule
====

About
-----
The Rule api is a parser combinator writen in TypeScript.
I use the Rule api as a backend for the Grammer api. But you can use it standalone if that's more your cup-of-thee.   

Building
--------
This project is build within Visual Studio Code and a installation of TypeScript 1.8 in the default directory.
If your install path of TypeScript is different then the default path then you should change the path in the ".vscode/tasks.json" file.
If everything is set, just press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build.
